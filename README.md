# Neural networks

3 labs

lab 1: classification on Titanic dataset.

lab 3: classification on Reuters dataset (GRU model).

lab 4: also classification on Reuters dataset but CNN model with attention layer.

P.S. glove.6B.50d.txt used in the work. But the file size is too big for github repository.
